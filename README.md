# Libdose, the simple*(-ish) C networking library

*## Features

* Inspired by the [plan9port](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/man3/dial.html) networking API
* All APIs are sync-only
* Cross-platform with support for modern Windows and Unix-like platforms
* No dependencies outside the C stdlib and a C99-capable compiler
* Single-header
* Focused - this library is for abstracting over sockets, not providing higher-level protocol implementations.
